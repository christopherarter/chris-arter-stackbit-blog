I've been working in my spare time to diversify my server-side languages beyond just PHP & Node, so I've been tackling some fun projects in .NET Core / C#. The latest is a [wholesome meme bot](https://twitter.com/daily_wholesome) that grabs memes from Reddit's json and tweets a random meme from that list. This is scheduled in CloudWatch to run every 4 hours.

In the spirit of wholesome memes, I wanted the bot to hopefully do a little good in the world, so I provided a donation link in the description to [St Jude's Children's Hopsital](https://www.stjude.org/donate/donate-to-st-jude.html). I will probably have the bot tweet out a link to that donation link as well a few times a month as the follower count grows.
