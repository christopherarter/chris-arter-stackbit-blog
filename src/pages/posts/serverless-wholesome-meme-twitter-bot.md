I've been working in my spare time to diversify my server-side languages beyond just PHP & Node, so I've been tackling some fun projects in .NET Core / C#. The latest is a wholesome meme bot that grabs memes from Reddit's json endpoints every 3 hours, and tweets a random selection. This is scheduled in CloudWatch to run every 4 hours.
