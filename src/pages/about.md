<img src="/images/IMG_20181003_190630(1).jpg" width="300" style="float:right;"/> Thanks for visiting my corner of the web! This place is filled mostly with short tutorials, thoughts and opinions on tech-related topics, and perhaps some cooking as well. We'll see.

My name is Chris Arter, and I'm a 30-something-year-old Software Engineer from sunny Florida. ðŸŒ´

#### Origin Story

My professional background is originally commercial aerospace, where I created the marketing strategy and branding for a startup, [TAG Aero](https://tag.aero). We went on to become the **#159 Fastest Growing Company in America**, and subsiquently nabbing the #316 spot the following year.

Starting as a simple aviation parts broker, TAG Aero blossumed into a full service supply and MRO shop for major commercial airlines.

Since we were a small and lean start up staff, I was also taking on development duties building internal tools. After a few years, I realized development was my true passion, and pivoted into this industry full-time.

#### Today

Today I write software for PartnerComm to support HR communications for Fortune 100 companies. I work in Wordpress, NodeJS, VueJS, and Laravel. I'm engaged to a wonderful woman and father to two beautiful girls.
