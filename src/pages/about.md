<img src="/images/IMG_20181003_190630(1).jpg" width="300" style="float:right;"/> Thanks for visiting my corner of the web! This place is filled mostly with short tutorials, thoughts and opinions on tech-related topics, and perhaps some cooking as well. We'll see.

My name is Chris Arter, and I'm a self-taught Software Engineer from sunny Florida. ðŸŒ´

#### Origin Story

During the recession (early 2010), I lived between my car and a friend's garage. I had no job, and plenty of time on my hands. I taught myself to code over stolen wi-fi on YouTube. That decision would ultimately change my life forever. A decade later, I earn a comfortable living and provide for my family. You can listen to my entire story on the [Tech Jr Podcast](https://techjr.dev/episodes/2020/living-in-a-garage-and-learning-to-code-chris-arter-shares-his-amazing-story/).

Since then I've worked in start-ups, agencies, lead gen firms as well as aerospace companies. [I've created brands that have made Inc 500s Fastest Growing Companies in America (twice).](https://www.inc.com/profile/the-auxiliary-group)

#### Today

Today I write software for PartnerComm to support HR communications for Fortune 100 companies. I build in Laravel, serverless NodeJS, .NET Core, Vue / Nuxt, and Wordpress.
